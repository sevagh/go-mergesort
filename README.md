# go-sort

A collection of Go sort experiments and implementations.

The goal of this project is to implement basic versions of **timsort** and **pdqsort** with minimal magic constants, etc. and validate their performance improvement over standard mergesort and quicksort.

Also included are:

* RadixSort (using counting sort on decimal digits)
* heapSort (from go/pkg/sort)
* insertionSort (from go/pkg/sort)

### Quicksort

| Function   | Source | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| QuickSort1 | CLRS | Naive pivot selection (A[r]) |
| QuickSort2 | [golang pkg/sort](https://golang.org/pkg/sort/#Sort) | Uses median-of-three partitioning, drops to insertionSort and heapSort in some cases |
| QuickSort3 | CLRS | Randomized pivot selection |
| PdqSort | [pdqsort](https://github.com/orlp/pdqsort) | No block quicksort - QuickSort2 with added bad partition detection and elimination |

QuickSort1 vs QuickSort3 shows the importance of picking good pivots in quicksort.

Parts of PdqSort implemented:

1. Check partitions that are bad and do swaps to fix them
    1. The Go QuickSort2 implementation is already always descending towards heapSort so leave that unchanged

### Mergesort

| Function   | Source | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| MergeSort1 | CLRS | Basic recursive implementation |
| MergeSort2 | [golang pkg/sort](https://golang.org/pkg/sort/#Stable) | Implements in-place symmetric merge ([[1]](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Stable-Minimum-Storage-Merging-by-Symmetric-Kim-Kutzner/d664cee462cb8e6a8ae2a1a7c6bab1b5f81e0618)) and does insertion sort by blocks |
| MergeSort3 | Goodrich & Tamassia | Bottom-up iterative merge sort |
| TimSort | Various timsort sources | No galloping, and uses the same in-place symmetric merge as MergeSort2 |

Parts of TimSort implemented:

1. Calculate minimum ascending runs of at least 32 in length (insertion sort to 32 if less)
    1. If the descending run is bigger, reverse it in-place and use that as the minrun
2. Record the boundaries between runs on which to merge the sorted minruns
3. Merge on the boundaries as follows (pseudocode):

```
boundaries = [[a, b], [b, c], [c, d], [d, e]]

for len(boundaries) > 1 {
    for i := 0; i < len(boundaries); i += 2 {
        // first iteration: i = 0
        // consider [a, b] and [b, c]
        symMerge(a, b, c)
        boundaries[0/2] = [a, c]

        // second iteration: i = 1
        // consider [c, d] and [d, e]
        symMerge(c, d, e)
        boundaries[1/2] = [c, e]
    }
    boundaries = boundaries[:len(boundaries)/2]
    // boundaries = [[a, c], [c, e]]
}
```

Benches for 1 million random ints:

I'm surprised by how well my naive implementation of timsort is performing - I'm sure it can be made better.
